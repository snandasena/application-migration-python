#### Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html)
##### Why we want to use logging instead of direct file writing?

The logging module is intended to be thread-safe without any special work needing to be done by its clients. It achieves this though using threading locks; there is one lock to serialize access to the moduleâ€™s shared data, and each handler also creates a lock to serialize access to its underlying I/O.

##### Logger levels
The numeric values of logging levels are given in the following table. These are primarily of interest if you want to define your own levels, and need them to have specific values relative to the predefined levels. If you define a level with the same numeric value, it overwrites the predefined value; the predefined name is lost.

|Log levels| Numeric value|
|----------|--------------|
| CRITICAL | 50 |
|ERROR | 40 |
|WARNING | 30|
|INFO | 20|
|DEBUG | 10|
NOTSET | 0|
##### Configuration logging in Python
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, 
                    format='%(asctime)s | %(message)s', 
                    datefmt='%d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S',
                    filename='vasabi-migrate.log', 
                    filemode='w')
                    
def task(*arg, **keyvalargs):
    logging.info(arg)
    
    logging.info(keyvalargs)
                    

```
